1. for updating the top 250 movies rating in the database, we could have a lambda function with cron job or schedule of the task of celery with request python library that run every or something!


2. since our use-case can is sorting, searching and reading kind of stuff. i think probably go with NoSQL database like MongoDB however i'll be using sql database with indexing on fields like name, rating date, etc
, however, I'll be using Redis databse for the cacheing

3. for logging of aws lambda function we couold use CloudWatch and for django level we can use django's defautl django loging module.

4. we can aslo use trasction sort of things then lambda get's fauilded in that case we can revert to their acutally stage.
